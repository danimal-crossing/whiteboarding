# Example whiteboarding problem: 
# Write a function that takes in two strings and returns the longest common substring.

# example input: "baseballs", "basketball"
# example output: "ball"

# Write a function that takes in 1 string and prints its out
# Write a function that takes in 1 string and splits it into an array and prints out the array
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings, split each into an array, loops through each array, and prints out each letter of each array
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings, loops through each letter of the first string, and compare the letter to each letter of the second string. Print the word "match" if they match
